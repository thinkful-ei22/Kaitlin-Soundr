## Soundr

The initial plan for this app was to create a Tindr-like app for the music service Soundcloud, but I ran into the issue of Soundloud's API being closed for public use. Currently, the app allows you to log in and out using Firebase as the database, and render/start/pause/resume one song.

This app was created using React Native, Firebase, and Expo.
